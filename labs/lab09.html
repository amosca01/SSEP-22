      <strong>Goal</strong>: by the end of this lab you will understand how to use the skills we’ve developed so far to perform exploratory data analysis.

    <h3 class="w3-text-grey">Setting up</h3>
    <p>
      Let’s load the packages we’re going to use in this lab.
    </p>
    <pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)</code></pre>

    <h3 class="w3-text-grey">Part 1: Looking through different datasets</h3>
    <p>
      Part of what exploratory data analysis is to look through several different datasets, begin to formulate big-picture questions, and see if or how we can answer those questions using the datasets.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of the following data is from <a href="https://www.gapminder.org/data/">gapminder.org</a>, which you also saw in Lab 5. Feel free to try out this process on your own with different data, either from the same site or another source!
    </p>
    <p>
      Often, before we start working with a specific dataset, we have a big, high-level question or topic we are interested in. Let's start this lab by saying <em>we want to make comparisons about countries<em>. The following parts of this lab start to investigate this high-level topic with different datasets. 
    </p>
    
    <h4 class="w3-text-grey">Dataset 1: Proportion of people who disagree that vaccines are effective</h4>

    <h5 class="w3-text-grey">Step 1: Read the description</h5>
    <p>
      The Gapminder description of these data is that "This is the proportion of people who <strong>disagree</strong> that vaccines are effective for children to have."
