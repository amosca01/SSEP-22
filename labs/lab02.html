    <h3 class="w3-text-grey">A Grammar for Data Transformation</h3>
    
    <p>
      The <code>dplyr</code> library provides a <em>grammar for data transformation</em>. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammar">grammar</a> is a set of rules that govern a language. In this case, <code>dplyr</code> provides a grammar that will allow you to express ideas about how to transform data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that a grammar consists of verbs, nouns, and direct objects.
    </p>
    <pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)</code></pre>
    <p>
      <strong>Goal</strong>: by the end of this lab, you will be able to use <code>dplyr</code> to transform a single data table.
    </p>

    <h4 class="w3-text-grey">The Five Verbs</h4>

    <p>
      The creator of <code>dplyr</code>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadley_Wickham">Hadley Wickham</a>, argues that most of the operations that you need to perform on a data table can be achieved using combinations of the following five &quot;verbs&quot;:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>select()</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>filter()</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>mutate()</code> (and <code>rename()</code>)
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>arrange()</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>summarize()</code>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Each of the five data &quot;verbs&quot; takes a data frame as its first argument and returns a data frame (actually a <code>tbl_df</code>). Because of this, these operations can be chained using the pipe operator (<code>%&gt;%</code>) (see below).
    </p>
    <p>
      When in doubt, reference the data transformation <a href="https://www.rstudio.org/links/data_transformation_cheat_sheet">cheat sheet</a>. Pay careful attention to the pictures!
    </p>

    <h4 class="w3-text-grey">Load in some data</h4>
    
    <p>
      We'll start by loading the <code>babynames</code> package, which contains data about names given to babies born in the United States beginning in 1880:
    </p>
    <pre class="r"><code>library(babynames)
    head(babynames)</code></pre>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Tip: if you want to learn more about a package or function in R, use the ? operator like this:
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <pre class="r"><code>?babynames</code></pre>
    <p>
      Now, let's play!
    </p>

    <h4><code>select()</code></h4>
    
    <p>
      You can extract a subset of the <strong>columns</strong> using <code>select()</code>:
    </p>
    <pre class="r"><code>babynames %&gt;%
      select(year, name, n) %&gt;%
      head()</code></pre>

    <h4><code>filter()</code></h4>
    
    <p>
      Similarly, you can extract a subset of the <strong>rows</strong> using <code>filter()</code>:
    </p>
    <pre class="r"><code># Replace &#39;Jordan&#39; with your own name if you like!
    babynames %&gt;%
      filter(name == &quot;Jordan&quot;) %&gt;%
      head()</code></pre>
    <p>
      You'll notice that inside the <code>filter()</code> command is a <strong>boolean statement</strong> (hence the double equals sign). This is because <code>filter()</code> is akin to asking for all rows where a particular condition is true (in this case, where the value of <code>name</code> is equal to &quot;Jordan&quot;).
    </p>
  
    <h4 class="w3-text-grey">Combining verbs (sneak peek)</h4>

    <p>
      Like with most programming languages, we can pass the value returned by one function into another function. The following code first <code>filter</code>s the data, then <code>select</code>s some specific columns, and finally assigns the result to a new object using the <code>&lt;-</code> operator:
    </p>
    <pre class="r"><code>jordan &lt;- babynames %&gt;%
                filter(name == &quot;Jordan&quot;) %&gt;%
                select(year, name, sex, n)</code></pre>
    <p>
      Now let's check the dimensions of that object:
    </p>
    <pre class="r"><code>dim(jordan)</code></pre>
    <p>
      We might also want to view the first few rows:
    </p>
    <pre class="r"><code>head(jordan)</code></pre>
    <p>
      And maybe verify what kind of object it is:
    </p>
    <pre class="r"><code>class(jordan)</code></pre>
    <p>
      Note that <code>jordan</code> is a <code>tbl_df</code>, a <code>tbl</code>, and a <code>data.frame</code>. Objects in R can have more than one type!
    </p>
    
    <h4 class="w3-text-grey">Visualization (sneak peek)</h4>

    <p>
      Let's make a quick plot of the popularity of <code>Jordan</code> over time. To do this, we'll use the <code>ggplot2</code> package:
    </p>
    <pre class="r"><code># Load ggplot
    library(ggplot2)

    # Create a ggplot object where:
    #   - the data is contained in the &#39;jordan&#39; object
    #   - the &#39;year&#39; column is mapped to the x-axis
    #   - the &#39;n&#39; column is mapped to the y-axis
    ggplot(data = jordan, aes(x = year, y = n)) + #&lt;- the &#39;+&#39; operator means we&#39;re adding to this plot
      # represent the data as a line chart,
      # break the data up by &#39;sex&#39; and give each group its own color
      geom_line(aes(color = sex))</code></pre>
    <p>
      Pretty cool, huh? Don't worry too much about the details of constructing this plot, we'll have a whole workshop on data visualization in a couple of weeks :-)
    </p>
 
    <h4><code>mutate()</code></h4>

    <p>
      We use the <code>mutate()</code> verb to create new variables. Here, we'll define a variable called <code>popular</code> that is <code>TRUE</code> if the name was assigned to more than 1% of all babies in that year.
    </p>
    <pre class="r"><code>babynames &lt;- babynames %&gt;%
      mutate(popular = prop &gt; 0.01)</code></pre>
    <p>
      Sometimes data comes in with weird or not-helpful variable names, but that's no problem. We can use <code>rename()</code> to rename a variable:
    </p>
    <pre class="r"><code>babynames &lt;- babynames %&gt;%
      rename(is_popular = popular)</code></pre>
    <p>
      Use the new variable (and <code>filter()</code>) to create a subset <strong>of the rows</strong>:
    </p>
    <pre class="r"><code>popular &lt;- babynames %&gt;%
      filter(is_popular)
    nrow(popular)
    head(popular)</code></pre>
    <p>
      What are the single most popular names of all time? To find them we can <code>arrange()</code> the table in descending order of the proportion of babies who got that name.
    </p>
    <pre class="r"><code>popular %&gt;%
      arrange(desc(prop))</code></pre>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        What does the value of the <code>prop</code> column in the first line of output above mean? Write one sentence to explain what it means to someone who has never taken a statistics course.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <pre class="r"><code># YOUR SOLUTION HERE</code></pre>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Next, choose a name and find the <code>year</code> in which that name was used <strong>most frequently</strong>.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <pre class="r"><code># YOUR SOLUTION HERE</code></pre>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        What was the <strong>most popular</strong> name that year?
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <pre class="r"><code># YOUR SOLUTION HERE</code></pre>
    <p>
      Finally, think about how you might answer the following question (though you might not be able to solve it just yet):
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        In which year was that name given to M and F babies most equally (i.e. <strong>closest to a 50/50 split</strong>)?
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <pre class="r"><code># YOUR SOLUTION HERE</code></pre>
    <p>
      The last single table verb is <code>summarize()</code> and it works a bit differently. Like all of the verbs, it takes a data table and returns a data table, but on its own, <code>summarize()</code> only returns a single row of output. In order to do this, it has to collapse entire columns into a single values. Thus, unless you tell <code>summarize()</code> <strong>how</strong> to condense the many pieces of information in a variable into a single value, it won't know what to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, we summarize <code>jordan</code> to find the greatest number of <code>Jordan</code>s born in a single year (to a single sex):
    </p>
    <pre class="r"><code>jordan %&gt;%
      summarize(max_jordans = max(n))</code></pre>
    <p>
      Note the difference between this and simply sorting the data table (which we can do using the verb <code>arrange()</code>, and if we want it in <strong>descending order</strong> with the biggest value at the top, we'll need to include <code>desc()</code> as well):
    </p>
    <pre class="r"><code>jordan %&gt;%
      arrange(desc(n))</code></pre>
    <p>
      If we wanted the whole row with the biggest <code>n</code>, we could also <code>filter()</code>:
    </p>
    <pre class="r"><code>jordan %&gt;%
      filter(n == max(n))</code></pre>
    <p>
      When using <code>summarize()</code>, it is almost always a good idea to count the number of rows that you collapsed. The value of this may not be immediately obvious, but it serves as a handy self-check that I promise you will save you lots of future debugging heartache. We can do this using the <code>n()</code> function.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Note: be careful not to confuse the function <code>n()</code>, which is always used inside a <code>summarize()</code> command, and the variable name <code>n</code>, which happens to be a column in the <code>babynames</code> table. It is purely coincidence that these have the same name!
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <pre class="r"><code>jordan %&gt;%
      summarize(num_rows = n(), max_jordans = max(n))</code></pre>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        What does the value of <code>num_rows</code> represent (in real-world terms) in the previous result? Explain what it means to another participant and argue about it until you agree.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3 class="w3-text-grey">So what's with the <code>%&gt;%</code> operator?</h3>

    <p>
      The pipe operator <code>%&gt;%</code> is provided by <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magrittr/vignettes/magrittr.html">the <code>magrittr</code> package</a>. It is automatically loaded by <code>dplyr</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The term <code>pipe</code> is an allusion to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_bar#Pipe">the use of <code>|</code> in Unix</a> to perform analogous operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The expression:
    </p>
    <pre class="r"><code>mydata %&gt;%
      verb(arguments)</code></pre>
    <p>
      is the same as:
    </p>
    <pre class="r"><code>verb(mydata, arguments)</code></pre>
    <p>
      In effect, <code>function(x, args) = x %&gt;% function(args)</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the <em>grammar of data transformation</em>, <code>mydata</code> is a noun, <code>verb()</code> is a verb, and <code>arguments</code> are the direct objects. The pipeline is closer to how we speak in English, while the nested syntax is more like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_notation">Polish Notation</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This means that instead of having to do:
    </p>
    <pre class="r"><code>select(filter(mutate(data, arguments), arguments), arguments)</code></pre>
    <p>
      You can do:
    </p>
    <pre class="r"><code>data %&gt;%
      mutate(arguments) %&gt;%
      filter(arguments) %&gt;%
      select(arguments)</code></pre>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Try rewriting the following expression using the pipe operator:
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <pre class="r"><code>arrange(select(filter(babynames, name == &quot;Jordan&quot;), -name), desc(prop))</code></pre>
