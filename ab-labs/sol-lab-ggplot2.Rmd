library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Introduction

**Goal**: by the end of this lab, you will be able to use `ggplot2` to build several different data-driven graphics.

### Setting up
**Remember**: before we can use a library like `ggplot2`, we have to load it:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```


### Why `ggplot2`?

Advantages of `ggplot2`

-   consistent underlying **grammar of graphics** (Wilkinson, 2005)
-   plot specification at a high level of abstraction
-   very flexible
-   `theme` system for polishing plot appearance (more on this later)
-   mature and complete graphics system
-   many users, active mailing list

### What Is The Grammar Of Graphics?

**The big idea**: independently specify plot building blocks and combine them to create just about any kind of graphical display you want. Building blocks of a graph include:

-   data
-   aesthetic mappings
-   geometric objects
-   statistical transformations
-   scales
-   coordinate systems
-   position adjustments
-   faceting

Using `ggplot2`, we can specify different parts of the plot, and combine them together using the `+` operator.

### Example Data: `Housing prices`

Let's start by taking a look at some data on housing prices:

``` {r}
housing <- read.csv("https://amosca01.github.io/SSEP-22/data/landdata-states.csv", 
                    header = T)
glimpse(housing)
```

(Data from <https://www.lincolninst.edu/subcenters/land-values/land-prices-by-state.asp>)

## Geometric Objects and Aesthetics

### Geometric Objects (`geom`)

Geometric objects or `geoms` are the actual marks we put on a plot. Examples include:

-   points (`geom_point`, for scatter plots, dot plots, etc)
-   lines (`geom_line`, for time series, trend lines, etc)
-   boxplot (`geom_boxplot`, for, well, boxplots!)
-   ... and many more!

A plot must have at least one `geom`; there is no upper limit. You can add a `geom` to a plot using the `+` operator.

You can get a list of available geometric objects by looking at the package documentation, available through the help interface:

``` {r}
?ggplot2
```

or simply type `geom_<tab>` in any good R IDE (such as Rstudio) to see a list of functions starting with `geom_`.

### Aesthetic Mapping (`aes`)

In `ggplot2`-land, *aesthetic* means "something you can see". Examples include:

-   position (i.e., on the x and y axes)
-   color ("outside" color)
-   fill ("inside" color)
-   shape (of points)
-   line type
-   size

Each type of `geom` accepts only a subset of all aesthetics -- refer to the `geom` help pages to see what mappings each `geom` accepts. Aesthetic mappings are set with the `aes()` function, short for aesthetic. 


### Points

Now that we know about geometric objects and aesthetic mapping, we're ready to make our first `ggplot`: a scatterplot. We'll use `geom_point` to do this, which requires `aes` mappings for `x` and `y`; all others are optional. 


``` {r}
hp2013Q1 <- housing %>% filter(Date == 2013.25) 

ggplot(hp2013Q1,
       aes(x = Land.Value,
           y = Structure.Cost)) +
  geom_point()
```
### Plot objects

The output of the `ggplot()` function is an object. If we want to modify the plot that we created above, itâ€™s helpful to store the plot as an object.

```{r}
p1 <- ggplot(hp2013Q1, 
             aes(x = Land.Value,      
                 y = Structure.Cost)) +
  geom_point()
```

To actually show the plot, we just print it. Note: the aesthetic mappings defined in p1, will be used by any subsequent `geom`s that we add unless we override them.

```{r}
p1
```

### Lines

A plot constructed with `ggplot` can have more than one `geom`. In that case, the mappings established in the `ggplot()` call are plot defaults that can be added to or overridden. For example, we could add an aesthetic mapping for color to `Home.Value`:

``` {r}
p1 + 
  geom_point(aes(color = Home.Value)) 
```

And we could add a regression line to our plot:
``` {r}
p1 + 
    geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

### Smoothers

Not all geometric objects are simple shapes -- as we saw above, `geom_smooth` includes both a line and a ribbon.

``` {r}
p1 +
  geom_point(aes(color = Home.Value)) +
  geom_smooth() # If we don't specify the method, what happens? 
                # Check the docs for more details (?geom_smooth)
```

### Removing standard errors

If you don't need the error bands, just set `se = FALSE` inside the call to `geom_smooth` to remove them:
``` {r}
p1 +
  geom_point(aes(color = Home.Value)) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
```

### Text

Each `geom` accepts a particualar set of mappings--for example `geom_text()` accepts a `labels` mapping.

``` {r}
p1 + 
  geom_point(aes(color = Home.Value)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = State), size = 3)
```

#. Try playing around with the `position` or `nudge_x/nudge_y` arguments to `geom_text` to see if you can offset the label from the associated point a bit.

### Aesthetic Mapping VS Assignment

Note that variables are mapped to aesthetics with the `aes()` function, while fixed visuals are set outside the `aes()` call. This sometimes leads to confusion, as in this example:

``` {r}
p1 +
  geom_point(aes(size = 2),     # not quite right! 2 is not a variable, but rather a fixed value
                 color = "red") # this is fine -- turns all points red
```
Notice how we get a pretty useless legend for size? That's because `R` is interpreting the constant `2` as a variable (just a boring one containing a single value) and so produces a legend by default.

#. Modify the code above to get rid of the legend by assigning the `size` attribute outside the call to `aes()`. While you're at it, try mapping `region` to `color` to see if there are any interesting patterns!

### Mapping Variables to Other Aesthetics

Other aesthetics are mapped in the same way as `x` and `y` in the previous example.

``` {r}
p1 +
  geom_point(aes(color = region, 
                 shape = region),
             size = 5)
```


## Scales: Controlling Aesthetics

Aesthetic mapping (i.e., with `aes()`) only says that a variable should be mapped to an aesthetic. It doesn't say *how* that should happen. For example, when mapping a variable to *shape* with `aes(shape = myVar)` you don't say *which* shapes should be used. Similarly, `aes(color = z)` doesn't say *which* colors should be used. Describing what colors/shapes/sizes etc. to use is done by modifying the corresponding *scale*. In `ggplot2`, `scales` include:

-   `position`
-   `color` and `fill`
-   `size`
-   `shape`
-   `linetype`

#.  Scales are modified with a series of functions using a `scale_<aesthetic>_<type>` naming scheme. Try typing `scale_<tab>` to see a list of scale modification functions, then play around to make the plot above look a little nicer.

### Common Scale Arguments

The following arguments are common to most `scales` in `ggplot2`:

-   `name`:  the first argument specifies the axis or legend title
-   `limits`: the minimum and maximum of the `scale`
-   `breaks`:  the points along the scale where labels should appear
-   `labels`: the text that appear at each break

#. Specific scale functions may have additional arguments; for example, the `scale_color_continuous` function has arguments `low` and `high` for setting the colors at the low and high end of the scale. Try playing around with the color scale to keep the outliers from dominating in this plot:

```{r}
# Tweak the color scale!
p1 + 
  geom_point(aes(color = Home.Value))
```

### Scale Modification Examples

Start by constructing a dotplot showing the distribution of home values by `Date` and `State`.

``` {r}
p3 <- ggplot(housing,
             aes(x = State,
                 y = Home.Price.Index))

p4 <- p3 + geom_point(aes(color = Date),
                      alpha = 0.5,
                      size = 1.5,
                      position = position_jitter(width = 0.25, height = 0))

p4
```
First, we will change the label on the vertical axis.

```{r}
p4 <- p4 + 
  scale_x_discrete(name = "State Abbreviation")

p4
```

Now let's modify the `breaks` and `labels` for the `x` axis and color scales:

``` {r}
p4 <- p4 + 
  scale_color_continuous(name = "",
                          breaks = c(1975.25, 1994.25, 2013.25),
                          labels = c(1971, 1994, 2013))
p4
```

Next change the low and high values to `blue` and `red`:

``` {r}
p4 <- p4 +
  scale_color_continuous(name = "",
                          breaks = c(1975.25, 1994.25, 2013.25),
                          labels = c(1971, 1994, 2013),
                          low = "blue", high = "red")
p4
```

### Using different color scales

`ggplot2` has a wide variety of color `scales`; here is an example using `scale_color_gradient2` to interpolate between three different colors:

``` {r}
p4 +
  scale_color_gradient2(name = "",
                        breaks = c(1975.25, 1994.25, 2013.25),
                        labels = c(1971, 1994, 2013),
                        low = "blue",
                        high = "red",
                        mid = "gray60",
                        midpoint = 1994.25)
```


### Available Scales

Here's a (partial) combination matrix of available scales:

| **Scale**         | **Types**  | **Examples**                     |
|-------------------|------------|----------------------------------|
| `scale_color_`    | `identity`   | `scale_fill_continuous`   |
| `scale_fill_`     | `manual`     | `scale_color_discrete`    |
| `scale_size_`     | `continuous` | `scale_size_manual`       |
|                            | `discrete`   | `scale_size_discrete`     |
| `scale_shape_`    | `discrete`   | `scale_shape_discrete`    |
| `scale_linetype_` | `identity`   | `scale_shape_manual`      |
|                            | `manual`     | `scale_linetype_discrete` |
| `scale_x_`        | `continuous` | `scale_x_continuous`      |
| `scale_y_`        | `discrete`   | `scale_y_discrete`        |
|                            | `reverse`    | `scale_x_log`             |
|                            | `log`        | `scale_y_reverse`         |
|                            | `date`       | `scale_x_date`            |
|                            | `datetime`   | `scale_y_datetime`        |

**Note**: in RStudio, you can type `scale_` followed by TAB to get the whole list of available scales.

## Faceting

-   Faceting is `ggplot2` parlance for **small multiples**
-   The idea is to create separate graphs for subsets of data
-   `ggplot2` offers two functions for creating small multiples:
    -  `facet_wrap()`: define subsets as the levels of a single grouping variable
    -  `facet_grid()`: define subsets as the crossing of two grouping variables
-   Facilitates comparison among plots, not just of `geoms` within a plot

### Example: what is the trend in housing prices in each state?

Let's start by using a technique we already know -- map `State` to `color`:

``` {r}
p5 <- ggplot(housing, aes(x = Date, 
                          y = Home.Value))

p5 + geom_line(aes(color = State))  
```

There are two problems here--there are too many `states` to distinguish each one by `color`, and the `lines` obscure one another.

### Faceting to the rescue!

We can fix the previous plot by `faceting` by `State` rather than mapping `State` to `color`:

``` {r}
p5 + geom_line() +
    facet_wrap(~State, ncol = 10)
```

There is also a `facet_grid()` function for faceting in two dimensions.


## Remember Tidy Data? 

### Map 2 (or more) Different Columns to one Aesthetic

A common question from `ggplot` beginners goes something like this: *I have two variables in my dataframe, and I'd like to plot them as separate points, with different colors depending on which variable it is. How do I do that?*

### First try: draw two separate lines

``` {r}
housing_byyear <- aggregate(cbind(Home.Value, Land.Value) ~ Date, data = housing, mean)

ggplot(housing_byyear, aes(x=Date)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = Home.Value), color="red") +
  geom_line(aes(y = Land.Value), color="blue")
```

This works but it is not so great, because if I later add another dimension, I'll have to remember that I hard-coded these lines separately. Plus because I didn't use an `aes()` mapping, I don't get a legend. Wah wah.

### Second try: A tidier way

First we'll `pivot_longer` the values we want to plot:
``` {r}
library(tidyr)
home_land_byyear <- pivot_longer(housing_byyear,
                            values_to = "value",
                            names_to = "type",
                            cols = c("Home.Value", "Land.Value"))
```

Then we'll plot them:
``` {r}
ggplot(home_land_byyear,
        aes(x = Date,
            y = value,
            color = type)) +
  geom_line()
```

Much cleaner!

## Your turn!
Now let's try building a few visualizations of your own. Try answering these questions using the `housing` dataset we've been using so far.

#. Create a scatterplot of the value of each home in the first quarter of 2013 as a function of the value of the land.
```{r}
# sample solution
    ggplot(hp2013Q1, aes(y = Home.Value, x = Land.Value)) + 
      geom_point()
```
#. Store the scatterplot that you created in the previous exercise as an object called `home_value_plot`.
```{r}
# sample solution
      home_value_plot <- ggplot(hp2013Q1,
      aes(y = Home.Value, x = Land.Value)) + 
    geom_point()
```
#. In your `home_value_plot`, map color to the cost of the structure and show your scatterplot.
```{r}
# sample solution
      home_value_plot + 
      aes(color = Structure.Cost) + 
      geom_point()
```
#. Let's return to p4. Since a home price index of 1 is an important benchmark, it is worth
highlighting as contextual reference in our plot. Use `geom_vline()` to add a dotted, black, vertical line to p4.
```{r}
# sample solution
p4 + 
      scale_color_gradient2(breaks = c(1975.25, 1994.25, 2013.25),
                        labels = c(1971, 1994, 2013),
                        low = "blue",
                        high = "red",
                        mid = "gray60",
                        midpoint = 1994.25) + 
      geom_hline(yintercept = 1, linetype = 3, color = "black")
```
#. Recall that layers in ggplot2 are added sequentially. How would you put the dotted horizontal line you created in the previous exercise **behind** the data values?
```{r}
# sample solution
p4 + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 1, linetype = 3, color = "black") + 
  scale_color_gradient2(breaks = c(1975.25, 1994.25, 2013.25),
                        labels = c(1971, 1994, 2013),
                        low = "blue",
                        high = "red",
                        mid = "gray60",
                        midpoint = 1994.25) 
```

#. Use a `facet_wrap` to create a data graphic of your choice that illustrates something interesting about home prices.
```{r}
# sample solution
    ggplot(housing, aes(x = Date, y = Home.Price.Index, color = State)) + 
      geom_hline(aes(yintercept = 1), linetype = 3, color = "black") + 
      geom_point(alpha = 0.1) +
      geom_line() + 
      facet_wrap(~region)
```
